Typically, however, Care Sites can provide care in multiple settings (inpatient, outpatient, etc.) and this granularity should be reflected in the visit.\n\nETL Conventions: Choose the concept in the visit domain that best represents the setting in which healthcare is provided in the Care Site. If most visits in a Care Site are Inpatient, then the place_of_service_concept_id should represent Inpatient. If information is present about a unique Care Site (e.g. Pharmacy) then a Care Site record should be created.
